                        <p>This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed  in Java using the GDB compiler. It is a command-line, two-player game where players take turns
                            selecting a box on the grid.I used the Set interface to ensure that no player can select an already occupied box.
                            The game checks for a winner after five moves, evaluating each row, column, and diagonal to determine if any player has won or not. </p>
